Django-SPDY/3 slides
====================
Slides of "Speed up your Django apps with Jython and SPDY" talk presented during [Codemotion][4] 2013 at Rome.
They are about the use of SPDY/3 protocol on Django application. The whole project is realized thanks to Jetty web container that has the "state of the art" for SPDY implementation.
